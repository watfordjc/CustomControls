# CustomControls
Figuring out dependency properties

This repository is an offshoot of [a comment in issue #4 of my StreamController repository](https://github.com/watfordjc/csharp-stream-controller/issues/4#issuecomment-664375177).

It is where I experiment with custom WPF controls until I work out how to get them to do what I want them to do.

Depending on the progress I make, this may end up as a library so I can reuse the code.
